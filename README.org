* pip-utils

state: functional, but needs more work and re-writing.

One command to know: =M-x pip-utils-hydra/body=.

- install packages from the requirements file,
- ask for a package, install it and optionally add it to the requirements file,
- get the package version,
- open the package's page on pypi,
- get its doc on another buffer (wip),
- change virtual env (with virtualenvwrapper, on melpa)
